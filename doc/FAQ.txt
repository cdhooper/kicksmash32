* What problem does KickSmash32 solve?

There are a few reasons why someone might want to change the ROM
installed in their Amiga. One might be that a new version of AmigaOS
has been released, and to use less RAM and shorten the boot time, it
is good to also install the ROM. Another reason might be that different
software (notably games) might require a certain Kickstart version.
Some people choose to modify the Kickstart ROM to add features, and
having the ability to test those changes, and easily switch back to
a standard ROM is very useful. Finally, if you need to diagnose problems
with your Amiga, you might need to use DiagROM or one of the other
Amiga diagnostic ROMs.

If you find the need to change ROMs in your Amiga becomes frequent,
this can be a tedious process with most Amiga systems. It usually
involves opening the case, removing the drives and drive tray, and may
also include removing the CPU or removing all expansion cards. As
compatible EPROMs are no longer manufactured, acquiring these parts is
becoming more difficult, and you still need to erase and program the
parts if you are doing it yourself. If you are doing it yourself, you
may need to also acquire an EPROM eraser and an EPROM programmer.

KickSmash32 solves some of these problems by using modern electronics.
It includes a programmer on the board, and the flash memory can be
erased in-system.

ROM images can be programmed by KickSmash in system by running a
program on the Amiga. Up to eight 512 KB ROM images may be stored and
switched between using either an Amiga command or by performing a long
(Control-Amiga-Amiga) reset.

In addition, the USB port on KickSmash32 may be connected to an external
external computer (host) so that ROM images can be programmed even when
the Amiga is not able to boot. The Amiga must be powered on and held in
reset in this case.

Regarding creating your own Kickstart ROM images, the scope is beyond
this FAQ. I would suggest reading up on Capitoline, the latest Amiga
kickstart editor. There are other utilities available to do the same,
such as amitools, or Remus / ROMsplit.

* Which Amiga models are supported by KickSmash?

KickSmash32 has been tested in several different Amiga 3000 and
Amiga 4000 rev B motherboards. KickSmash32 will not work in Amiga 3000
rev 7 and below motherboards without a specific adapter, as those
machines require a ROM Tower. An Amiga 3000 ROM tower replacement with
spacing compatible with KickSmash32 is available here:
    https://github.com/cdhooper/amiga_rombankswitcher_a3000_romtower
KickSmash4KT is for the Amiga 4000T, and has been tested.
KickSmash3KT is for the Amiga 3000T. It has not yet been tested. You need
             to supply a swapping flag (-s 1032) when programming over
             USB. This board also works in the AA3000+, but the swapping
             flag is not necessary there.
KickSmash1200 is for the Amiga 1200. It has been found to have issues with
             TF1260 and other CPU accelerators due to an issue with Gayle.
             There is no current workaround.
KickSmash4KCR is for the Amiga 4000CR. It has been tested in Chucky's
             ReAmiga4000CR.

With further software development, a version can probably be made to
support the Amiga 500, 600, and 2000.

* How do I install KickSmash?

It's recommended to connect KickSmash by USB to your PC for testing
before installing it in the Amiga. KickSmash firmware does a pin test
when connected outside an Amiga. This will also allow you to update
KickSmash firmware and program an initial Kickstart ROM image.
See `doc/sw_install.txt` for instructions. Read `doc/sw_hostsmash.txt` for
further information on programming Kickstart images.

KickSmash requires a connection to the Amiga's KBRST signal. You will
need to attach a jumper from a spot on the board to the KBRST pin on
KickSmash. See `doc/hw_install.txt` for details on this.

Download the latest software release from the KickSmash github repository:
    https://github.com/cdhooper/kicksmash32

Install files from the `amiga` directory on your Amiga. The `sw` directory
contains `hostsmash` executables for Linux, Windows, and MacOS. This
utility is used to program firmware images on KickSmash over USB.
Files in the `fw` directory are the STM32 firmware of the KickSmash board.

========================================================================

* Can I use Windows as a host?

Although use under Windows is not well supported compared to Linux,
you should be able to program and use KickSmash from the Windows
command prompt. See `doc/windows_notes.txt` for useful information.

========================================================================

* Why does the ROM Switcher give me errors such as "FAIL Get NV 512"?

Errors such as "FAIL Get NV 512" or "FAIL set reboot -8" in the
ROM Switcher could be due to a version mismatch, motherboard jumper
settings, or due to a hardware build issue.

The software interface changed between 1.5 and 1.6 releases. If you are
using some software which is before 1.6 and some which is at or after 1.6,
this failure is expected. Upgrade your ROM switcher or Amiga software.

Your motherboard should be set to the slowest speed setting for the
Amiga CPU to reliably communicate with the STM32 CPU on the KickSmash.
A3000: J151 and J152 should be set to 1-2 (25 MHz operation)
A3000T: J151 and J152 should be set to 1-2 (25 MHz operation)
A4000: J151 should be set to 1-2 (ROMSPEED 200ns)
A4000T: J151 should be removed (200ns)

It could also be due to a hardware build issue. If your Amiga is booting
from KickSmash, and if it's a hardware build issue, then it's probably
localized to the STM32 CPU itself. Check the SOCKET_OE and FLASH_OE pins
on the STM32.

* A new Kickstart ROM just came out. How do I program and switch to it?

Let's assume you've been running your Amiga with KickSmash for the past
few months and just purchased and downloaded the latest Kickstart 3.2.3.
Now you'd like to program that version and switch to it as the default.

From AmigaOS, you download the appropriate ROM image for your Amiga.
Show the configuration:
    9.Boot:> smash bank show
    Bank  Name            Merge LongReset  PowerOn  Current  NextReset
    0     KS3221                           *        *
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6     DiagROM
    7     ROM Switcher          0

Let's program the new ROM in bank 1. Start by erasing the bank:
    9.Boot:> smash erase bank 1
    Erase bank=1 addr=0 len=80000
    Proceed - are you sure? (y/n) y
    Progress [................................]
    Erase complete in 2.08 sec

now program it:
    9.Boot:> smash write file A4000T.47.115.rom bank 1 verify
    Write bank=1 addr=0 len=80000 from file="A4000T.47.115.rom"
    Proceed - are you sure? (y/n) y
    Progress [..                              ]

about 45 seconds later (depending on your CPU)...
    Progress [................................]
      Verify [................................]
    Write complete in 40.06 sec
    Verify complete in 1.28 sec

Now name the bank and set it as the poweron default:
    9.Boot:> smash bank name 1 KS323
    9.Boot:> smash bank poweron 1

Switch to that bank and reboot the Amiga
    9.Boot:> smash bank nextreset 1 reboot

The equivalent can also be done from your host, if connected by USB.
Linux example (you may need to specify -d <DEV>):
    % hostsmash -t prom bank show
    % hostsmash -wv Update3.2.3/ROMs/A4000T.47.115.rom -b 1 -y
    % hostsmash -t prom bank name 1 KS323
    % hostsmash -t prom bank poweron 1
    % hostsmash -t prom bank current 1
    % hostsmash -t reset amiga
