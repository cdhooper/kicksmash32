KickSmash Hardware Build
------------------------

Use files in the rev4 directory to have a fab house build a PCB.
HASL is fine. I use JLCPCB for most of my builds.

My general order for building these boards is:
    1. Top side STM32
    2. Top side Flash chips
    3. Bottom side 74FCT162244 parts
    4. USB-C connector
    5. AM1117-3.3 voltage regulator and 8 MHz oscillator
    6. All passives
    7. LEDs are last
    8. Right angle header for STM32 SWD (if desired)
    9. Right angle header for KBRST pin (required)
   10. Right angle header for console (I usually don't install this)
   11. Bottom pin headers

For in-system fit, you might choose to install the 7 and 8 headers
on the bottom side of the board rather than the top.

The bottom pin headers are two 20-pin and two 9-pin. Note they are 20-pin,
not 21-pin, unless your Amiga has been modified to add more address lines
from a device such as Romy. Before installing any headers, I recommend
that you jump to programming with the ST-Link or by USB DFU. If you need
to remove shorts, improve soldering, or correct part orientation, it's
much easier to do without the pin headers in place.

You can choose to use machined pin (round) or Flip-Pins. Don't use standard
Dupont-style male headers. These are too thick (0.5mm+) and will damage
your ROM sockets. Machined pins are around 0.35mm, and Flip-Pins are around
0.25mm. I like the Flip-Pins, but I've discovered they are much more
difficult to install in the Amiga ROM sockets than machined pins.

For the LEDs, I use purple for POWER, Orange for READ, and Green for WRITE.
Feel free to use your own color scheme. The reason I like purple for POWER
is that it's the only LED which is on all the time, and I found that Green
is too bright for that.

After the board is built, follow the hw_programming.txt guide.
