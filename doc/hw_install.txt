KickSmash Hardware Install
--------------------------

KickSmash has so far only been tested in Amiga 3000, 4000, and 4000T systems.
There are known issues with KickSmash in the Amiga 1200, specifically with
the TF1260 and other CPU accelerators. This combination is not recommended.
The issue is Gayle, which will glitch ROM enables to KickSmash while code is
running on the TF.

1. Turn off your computer
    It had to be said.

2. Locate and attach a wire for the KBRST pin
    I usually put a female Dupont connector on a wire, and solder the
    other side to a component on the motherboard. The Dupont connetor
    would then attach to the KBRST pin on KickSmash.

    Amiga 1200:   solder or clip a wire to TP1 pin 9, U13 pin 38,
                  U5 pin 63, or a via near the E121R silkscreen.
    Amiga 3000:   use RP701 pin 6 or U713 pin 1.
    Amiga 3000T:  use RP701 pin 6 or U713 pin 1.
    Amiga 4000:   use U141 pin 1.
    Amiga 4000CR: use U141 pin 1.
    Amiga 4000T:  use U141 pin 1.
    Amiga AA3000: use U693 pin 1.
    AmigaPCI:     use CN210 near ROM socket

3. Remove your old Kickstart ROMs
    It's best to use a chip extractor to remove the ROM chips. If you must use
    a flat head screwdriver, be very careful to not damage traces on your
    motherboard. Pry against the socket, not the motherboard.

4. Set your ROM speed jumper to the slowest setting (highest ns)
    A3000:   J151 and J152 should be set to 1-2 (25 MHz operation)
    A3000T:  J151 and J152 should be set to 1-2 (25 MHz operation)
    A4000:   J151 should be set to 1-2 (ROMSPEED 200ns)
    A4000CR: J151 should be set to 1-2 (ROMSPEED 200ns)
             On the bottom of the PCB, you might also need to bodge the
             right side of R151 to the right side of R173.
    A4000T:  J151 should be removed (200ns)
    AA3000+: J120 and J121 should be set to 1-2 (25 MHz)

4. Install KickSmash in place of the ROMs
    The USB connector of KickSmash should face the same side of the ROM
    sockets as the notch of the ROMs you've removed.
    Amiga 1200: Orient KickSmash with the USB connector facing Gayle and
            the 28 MHz crystal oscillator. If KickSmash pins A20 and A21
            are not populated, do not install the KickSmash in A1200
            socket pins 1 and 42.
    Amiga 3000: Orient KickSmash with the USB connector facing Fat Gary.
    Amiga 3000T: Orient KickSmash with the USB connector next to the
            motherboard's SCSI connector.
    Amiga 4000: Orient KickSmash with the USB connector facing the 50 MHz
            oscillator and Fat Gary.
    Amiga 4000CR: Orient KickSmash with the USB connector emerging next
            to Ramsey.
    Amiga 4000T: Orient KickSmash with the USB connector overlapping Fat Gary.
    AmigaPCI: Orient KickSmash with the USB connector facing Agnus

    Be careful to ensure that all pins are aligned correctly with the
    socket leaf springs before applying force to install KickSmash
    into the sockets.

5. Attach your KBRST wire to the KBRST pin on KickSmash

6. Optionally attach the A18 (CPU A20) and A19 (CPU A21) pins to Romy
   or a physical switch to select Kickstart images.

7. Optionally attach a USB-C cable to your KickSmash
    This cable would be routed out the back of your Amiga and then
    connected to your host. Leaving the USB-C connected provides for
    the possibility of a couple features which will be explained in
    the software guides. One feature is that you can still program
    flash while the KickSmash is installed in the Amiga. The Amiga
    just needs to be put in reset during this operation. Another
    feature is that software on the Amiga can communicate with the
    hostsmash application for host file access.

8. Optionally attach your ST-Link and serial console
    It's not necessary unless you plan to do firmware programming. Ensure
    the cable is oriented correctly.

9. Power on your computer
    If you previously attached your USB-C cable to your host computer,
    the KickSmash power LED should have already been on while your
    Amiga was still powered off. If not, once you power on your Amiga,
    the KickSmash POWER LED should illuminate. If it doesn't, and it
    did previously when you were testing stand-alone, you should
    immediately turn off your computer. Something isn't right. If you
    don't see the POWER LED, it could be that KickSmash is misaligned
    in the socket.

10. Watch for signs of life from your Amiga
    You should see immediate READ LED activity on the KickSmash.
    Your Amiga power LED should go from dim to bright. These are
    excellent signs that things are working.

    There are many potential causes for your Amiga not starting up
    correctly at this point. One is that the installed ROM image is
    not correct for this machine, or it was installed with incorrect
    byte swapping.

    KickSmash might be able to help you identify what is going wrong.
    You can use the hostsmash utility to connect as you did before
    when testing the board standalone:
        ./hostsmash -d /dev/ttyACM0 -t

    The "prom log" command may be used to show the most recent
    addresses that the Amiga fetched from flash. Example from a
    working Amiga:
        CMD> prom log
        Ent ROMAddr AmigaAddr
        733 00522   01488
        734 00523   0148c
        735 0055a   01568
        736 0055b   0156c
        737 00554   01550
        738 00555   01554
        739 00556   01558
        740 00557   0155c
        741 00558   01560
        742 00559   01564

    Every time you execute the command, it will show you the most
    recent addresses accessed. If the list is not changing, that likely
    means the Amiga has faulted. If there are no entries in the list,
    then the Amiga CPU is probably not fetching at all.

    One can kick off an Amiga reset and capture addresses. Example:
        CMD> reset amiga ; reset amiga hold ; prom log 6
        Resetting Amiga
        Holding Amiga in reset
        Ent ROMAddr AmigaAddr
        199 055e4   15790
        200 055e5   15794
        201 055e6   15798
        202 055e7   1579c
        203 055e8   157a0
        204 07306   1cc18
    If very few addresses are driven on the bus before the Amiga CPU
    stops, this is a good hint that it's faulting and stopping.

Once you have your Amiga booting, follow the sw_install.txt guide.
