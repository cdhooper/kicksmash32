KickSmash hardware programming
------------------------------

There are two ways to program firmware on your KickSmash.
    1. ST-Link (requires the hardware programmer)
    2. USB DFU mode

I prefer using the ST-Link for rapid programming cycles because it's
fast and requires less manual intervention to get new firmware loaded.
An advantage of using USB DFU mode is that it does not require any
programmer hardware. You just need a computer which has a DFU updater.
On Linux, dfu-util is the recommended DFU updater. Depending on your
Linux distribution, you might use one of the following commands to
install it:
    dnf install dfu-util
    yum install dfu-util
    apt-get install dfu-util
On MacOS, you can install dfu-util using brew:
    brew install dfu-util

In either case, you will need a computer that you can connect by
USB-C to your KickSmash. You will also need to build firmware for
KickSmash. I recommend Linux (Fedora), but have used MacOS in the past.

1. Go to the fw directory and type make.
    If you run into build failures, you probably will need to install
    development libraries such as gcc, the USB library (libusb1-devel),
    or the gcc cross-compiler for ARM (gcc-arm-linux-gnu).

    You might also need to build in the libopencm3 or stutils directories
    immediately under fw. These are third party software which are
    configured as git submodules, and required to build and install
    the KickSmash firmware.

2. Connect KickSmash
    If you plan to use ST-Link, connect this first, then attach your
    ST-Link to your computer, and finally attach your KickSmash USB-C
    port to your computer. Note that many low-cost ST-Micro Discovery
    boards have a built-in ST-Link that you can use to program external
    devices. You just need to disconnect a couple jumpers in that case.
    I usually use an STM32F4-Discovery board and a 6-pin Dupont cable.
    The KickSmash SWD header pin order is identical to that of the
    STM32F4-Discovery board.

    If you plan to use DFU mode, first short the DFU pin with the V3P3
    pin right next to it, then attach your USB-C cable to your computer.
    You can then release the short of the DFU pin. After several seconds
    (10 or so), the STM32F105 or STM32F107 should appear in your USB
    device list (lsusb). Example:
        lsusb|grep DFU
        Bus 001 Device 101: ID 0483:df11 STMicroelectronics STM Device in DFU Mode

    You might see the READ LED is illuminated and the POWER LED is off.
    This is normal for an unprogrammed board. If no LED lights up, then
    unplug USB and inspect your board for shorts or missing components.
    A common cause of missing voltage is the diode next to the AM1117
    is installed backwards.

3. Program the firmware
    Assuming you are on Linux and have the necessary packages installed,
    this should be pretty straightforward. If you are on Windows, refer
    to the separate doc/windows_notes.txt file

    If you are using the ST-Link, type:
        make flash

    If you are using DFU mode, and the board is already connected and
    shows up on your computer, type:
        make dfu

    if you are on MacOS, you might need to first build the firmware and
    then type:
        make just-dfu

    When programming in DFU mode, you should see output including the
    following:
        Erase           [=========================] 100%        87036 bytes
        Erase    done.
        Download        [=========================] 100%        87036 bytes
        Download done.

    If you are dealing with questionable parts from random vendors on
    the net (as I often do), you might find some STM32 CPUs come
    pre-programmed and protected. Typical error output in that case
    might appear as:
        Erase           [                         ]   0%            0 bytesdfu-util: ERASE_PAGE not correctly executed
    If in DFU mode, you might be able to unprotect and use these parts
    by first using the following command:
        make dfu-unprotect
    You'll need to wait several seconds again for the device to then
    be recognized again by your host.

    After initial DFU programming, you will probably need to power cycle
    the board by unplugging and plugging in the USB cable again.

4. Test the board
    After programming, your KickSmash should have reset and started
    running its firmware. At this point, you should see the power LED is
    illuminated. If you don't see this, then try unconnecting and
    reconnecting the USB-C cable. If this doesn't make your power LED
    illuminate, then further debug will be required.

    Assuming your power LED is on, you should see the KickSmash USB device
    should now appear (lsusb). Example:
        lsusb | grep -i KickSmash
        Bus 001 Device 090: ID 1209:1610 Generic KickSmash Prg

    Your computer should have a new ACM device installed, and to which
    you can use any terminal program to connect (bps rate doesn't matter).
    What I use and recommend is the host utility which is part of the
    KickSmash software. Go to the sw directory and type make.
    It should build a utility called hostsmash. Run it as follows:
        ./hostsmash -d /dev/ttyACM0 -t
    Press return and you should see output similar to:

        Kicksmash 32 Version 0.1 built 2024-05-03 09:12:34
            CPUID=411fc231 Dev=0418 Rev=1001 (compile: STM32F107xC BOARD=4)
            Hardware: STM32F1    Connectivity revision Z
            HCLK=72 MHz  APB1=36 MHz  APB2=72 MHz
            Power-on reset
        New config
        Connected: !A17 A18 A19 D31 !KBRST Flash0 Flash1
        Standalone
        CMD> config write at 3e000
        CMD>

    If you see other output, especially errors such as pin shorts
    detected, you should check your soldering before proceeding.
    Pin shorts or floating signals must be resolved before installing
    in your computer.

    Assuming you don't see any errors, your next step should be to
    verify that the STM32 can talk with both flash chips. The
    easiest way to do this is to use the "prom id" command:
        CMD> prom id
        000122d2 000122d2 M29F160FT M29F160FT
    In the above, you see both parts are responding and were identified
    correctly. You can press ^X (control-X) to exit the terminal session.

5. Load an initial Kickstart image
    You must own rights to the image you are about to install. I do not
    condone piracy, even of 30+ year old software. I recommend using
    the latest AmigaOS 3.2.2 ROM from Hyperion. The following command
    will install the Amiga 3000 version of the 3.2.2 Kickstart ROM:
        ./hostsmash -wv -path-to-OS-/Update3.2.2/ROMs/A3000.47.111.rom -s 3210 -d /dev/ttyACM0 -b 0

    Later guides will explain hostsmash command options in detail.
    The options used above are:
        -w               Write an image to flash
        -v               Verify the write was successful.
        -s 3210          Byte swap the image suitable for the A3000.
        -d /dev/ttyACM0  ACM device on your computer. If you're using
                         MacOS, you might use "/dev/cu.usbmodem*" instead.
        -b 0             Write to flash bank 0 (banks are numbered 0-7).

After you've completed hardware programming, follow the hw_install.txt guide.
