KickSmash Software installation
-------------------------------

Installing KickSmash board firmware
    A brief recap from hw_install.txt is that you've successfully pulled the
    KickSmash repository from github:
        https://github.com/cdhooper/kicksmash32

    At this point, if you built KickSmash yourself, you've likely already
    built firmware in the fw directory and host (Linux) software in the sw
    directory. You've also likely already programmed the firmware. If not,
    please review that section from hw_install.txt.

    Once your KickSmash has been programmed, you can apply a firmware
    update without setting the DFU jumper again. The "reset dfu" command
    may be used to tell KickSmash to enter DFU mode. Example:
        ./hostsmash -d /dev/ttyACM0 -t
        CMD> reset dfu
        Resetting to DFU...

    After several seconds, you should see the device appear on your host.
            lsusb|grep DFU
            Bus 001 Device 101: ID 0483:df11 STMicroelectronics STM Device in DFU Mode

    You can then use "make dfu" in the fw to apply your updated firmware.

Installing Amiga software
    There is not yet an installer script or really any packaging
    implemented for KickSmash Amiga software. Copy the following
    utilities from the host's amiga build directory to your system
    using whatever means you have available. You can place those
    utilities in C: or in another directory you've added to your path.
        smash
        smashftp

Installing Amiga software
Amiga software
    The amiga directory contains a Makefile which will build a few
    AmigaOS programs:
        1. smash
        2. smashftp
        3. smashfs

    The smash utility can be used to communicate with your KickSmash
    from AmigaOS. It supports a variety of options, including ones
    which allow you to erase and program your flash. Example:
        9.OS322:> smash write file 322.rom bank 3
        Write bank=3 addr=0 len=80000 from file="322.rom"
        Proceed - are you sure? (y/n) y
        Progress [...                             ]
    ...
        Progress [................................]
        Write complete in 63.67 sec
        9.OS322:> smash -v -f 322.rom -b 3
        Verify bank=3 addr=0 len=80000 matches file="322.rom"
        Proceed - are you sure? (y/n) y
          Verify [................................]
        Verify complete in 2.39 sec

    The smashftp utility can be used to transfer files to and from
    your host. It requires your host to be running the hostsmash
    utility with at least one volume exported. Example:
        ./hostsmash -d /dev/ttyACM0 -m home: /home -m a: /amiga -m root: /
    From there, you can start smashftp on the Amiga and access exported
    volumes and files.
        10.OS322:> smashftp
        smashftp> list
        root:                            Volume -------- 2024-05-03 09:32:25
        a:                               Volume -------- 2024-05-03 09:32:25
        home:                            Volume -------- 2024-05-03 09:32:25
        smashftp> list a:smash
        smash                             72796 ----rwed 2024-05-02 23:15:27
        smashftp> get a:smash
        Get a:smash as smash (72796 bytes)  53 KB/sec

    The smashfs program is a automatic mount filesystem for the Amiga.
    If you run the program, by default it will run in the foreground of
    your shell. Press ^C to unmount any volumes and exit smashfs once
    you've closed all files. You can put the filesystem in the background
    with the Run command. Example:
        9.SDH0:> run smashfs
        [CLI 7]
        9.SDH0:> info home:

        Mounted disks:
        Unit      Size       Used       Free Full Errs   Status   Name
        home       92G   21652641    2584756  89%   0  Read/Write home

        Volumes available:
        home [Mounted]
        9.SDH0:> status com=smashfs
         7
        9.SDH0:> break 7
        9.SDH0:> info home:
        device (or volume) is not mounted
