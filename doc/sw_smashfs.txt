smashfs - Amiga Filesystem for host-exported volumes
----------------------------------------------------

The smashfs filesystem is started like a regular Amiga program. Once started,
it will automatically detect and mount exported volumes from the remote host.
Most standard Amiga programs such as Workbench, Info, List, and Textedit may
be used to access files and directories on the remote host.

The smashfs program can normally be shut down by pressing ^C in the window
where it was started. To run the program in the background, use the "Run"
command. If you need to shut it down in that case, you can use the CLI
"Status" command to find smashfs and the "Break" command to shut it down.

In order to export a volume to the Amiga, you will use the hostsmash
program on your host computer. This command may be executed before or
after starting up smashfs. While smashfs is running, it will occasionally
poll the host for exported volumes.

Here's a simple command to get you started (run it from the sw directory
in the KickSmash repository):
    ./hostsmash -d /dev/ttyACM0 -m amiga: ../amiga

If you execute the Info command after smashfs is started, you will see
a new "amiga" Mounted disk and Volume have appeared:
    9.OS322:> info

    Mounted disks:
    Unit      Size       Used       Free Full Errs   Status   Name
    amiga    1760G     434817    1368225  24%   0  Read/Write amiga
    RAM        15M         35      15868   0%   0  Read/Write RAM Disk
    S0       1019M      78688     965535   8%   0  Read/Write OS322
    S1       1011M     147724     111322  57%   0  Read/Write Work

    Volumes available:
    amiga [Mounted]
    OS322 [Mounted]
    RAM Disk [Mounted]
    Work [Mounted]

The Workbench desktop should also show a new "amiga" volume. You can
open this volume and access files just as you would any other Amiga
volume.
