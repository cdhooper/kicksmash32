smashfsrom - ROMable Amiga Filesystem for host-exported volumes
---------------------------------------------------------------

See the documentation on smashfs for an overview of what smashfs is.

smashfsrom is a version of smashfs which can be included in the
Kickstart ROM in order to provide smashfs at boot. It currently does
not support booting from a smashfs volume, but that might be added in
the future.

There is also smashfsrom_d, which is smashfsrom, but also emits file
access debug output on the Amiga serial point.
