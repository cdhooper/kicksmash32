DFU Programming
---------------

DFU programming from Windows requires dfu-util. You will need to acquire
that utility and install that on your system.
    https://dfu-util.sourceforge.net/
    https://dfu-util.sourceforge.net/releases/

There is a dfu.bat file in the firmware directory which can be used to
run dfu-util from Windows. Follow other instructions in hw_programming.txt
for setting up your board for DFU programming.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Windows COM port driver
-----------------------
When KickSmash is running, it will present a generic serial device to
the host over the USB connection. Unlink Linux, Windows requires a driver
for generic serial devices. Windows 10+ have a built-in generic serial
driver which should function with KickSmash, but you may need to tell
your computer to use the generic driver.

If you see "KickSmash Prg" under other devices, then you at least know
the KickSmash is now running the firmware. Under "Ports (COM & LPT)"
you should see a new "USB Serial Device (COMx)" but the Device Status
may have an error, such as
    Device status
    This device cannot start. (Code 10)
    A device which does not exist was specified.

You can try using the following driver:
    https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32/blob/master/drivers/win/wdi-simple.exe?raw=true

And tell it to manage KickSmash serial:
    wdi-simple.exe --vid 0x1209 --pid 0x1610 --type 3 --name "KickSmash Prg" --dest "maple-serial"

If you have wget installed, you can run the wdikicksmash.bat file in the
sw directory to do both.

After installing the above, you will need to plug in your KickSmash board
again.

-------
Another option for older Windows version might be the STMSW-STM32102
Virtual COM port driver installation package for Windows:
    https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-stm32102.html

Extract the zip file and install the Windows 7 version.
Go to
    C:\Program Files\STMicroelectronics\Software\Virtual comport driver\Win7
Edit
    stmcrc.inf
and change the two lines which look like
    %DESCRIPTION%=DriverInstall,USB\VID_0483&PID_5740
to:
    %DESCRIPTION%=DriverInstall,USB\VID_1203&PID_1610
then run
    w7_install.bat

Hostsmash debugging
-------------------

If you find that hostsmash.exe emits an error while attempting to
program a Kickstart ROM, especially if you see
    0%Remote sent error 78
then it could be due to a communication failure or some other failure
with the KickSmash. You can get a complete log of the interaction
beween hostsmash and Kicksmash by setting the TERM_DEBUG environment
variable. At a command prompt, enter:
    setx TERM_DEBUG out.txt

Then run the hostsmash command again. A "out.txt" file will be
created in the current directory, and the content of the file may
help debug the problem.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hostsmash under Wine
--------------------

Hostsmash.exe is a port of the Linux hostsmash utility to Windows.
It is usually tested using Wine under Linux. For this reason, you
might encounter problems on a real Windows installation which were
not caught during development.

In ~/.wine/dosdevices you will find symlinks to system devices
there. You might already have something mapped to /dev/ttyACM0,
which would be the first ACM device attached to your host. This
is probably KickSmash. If you have other ACM devices, then you
may need to create further links.
    % cd ~/.wine/dosdevices>
    % ls -l|grep ACM
    lrwxrwxrwx. 1 USR GRP 12 2025-01-15 21:55 com33 -> /dev/ttyACM0
    % wine hostsmash.exe -d COM33 -t
    [ wine "fixme" output removed ]
    << Type ^X to exit.  Opened COM33 >>

COM Ports

If you are programming multiple Kicksmash boards, it may be annoying that
each Kicksmash gets assigned a unique COM device. There is a solution for
this:
    REG ADD "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\COM Name Arbiter" /v ComDB /t REG_BINARY /d 0206 /f

This removes all COM ports, so if you run the command between each Kicksmash
board, you'll repeatably get the same COM port. Here's a batch file which
might help you get started with automating programming:
    @echo off
    REG ADD "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\COM Name Arbiter" /v ComDB /t REG_BINARY /d 0206 /f
    cd c:\firmware\kicksmash

    sw\hostsmash_win64.exe -d com3 -w \\curry\share\Amiga\kickstarts\A1200\KickstartV3.1-V40.68-A1200.rom -b 0 -s 3210 -y
    sw\hostsmash_win64.exe -d com3 -t "prom bank name 0 Kick3.1"

    sw\hostsmash_win64.exe -d com3 -w \\curry\share\Amiga\kickstarts\A1200\A1200.47.115.rom -b 1 -s 3210 -y
    sw\hostsmash_win64.exe -d com3 -t "prom bank name 1 Kick3.2.3"

    sw\hostsmash_win64.exe -d com3 -w diagrom.rom -b 2 -s 3210 -y
    sw\hostsmash_win64.exe -d com3 -t "prom bank name 2 DiagROMV2-Daily"
