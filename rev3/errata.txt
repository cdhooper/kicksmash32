Add 10nF capacitor between NRST and VCC for STM32 SWD to work reliably
    Maybe a pull-up would work better. Need to investigate further.
    Pull-up did not appear to work better.
    Not needed -- fix for shorted 3.3V and 5V nets solved this problem

Flip silkscreen for 74FCT162244 parts
    Fixed in Rev 4

Move KBRST pin closer to the right edge
    Fixed in Rev 4

Move JTAG/SWD connector slightly closer to right edge
    Fixed in Rev 4

Make it so EEPROM A17 can also be overridden as A3000/A4000 never drives
    these pins low except maybe when starting up (before jump + OVF).
    Need to add resistor between socket pin and rest of net
    Fixed in Rev 4

FLASH_CE should be connected to GND and not STM32 PB12.
    Fixed in Rev 4

Need direct connection between STM32 PB12 and D31 so STM32 can probe
    whether it's installed in a 32-bit Amiga.

R7 10K between SOCKET_OE and FLASH_OE is too slow. Switch to 470 Ohm.
    Fixed in Rev 4

R8 10K between SOCKET_A19 and FLASH_19 is too slow. Switch to 4.4K or 4.7K.
    Fixed in Rev 4 - used 3.3K

R9 10K between SOCKET_A18 and FLASH_18 is too slow. Switch to 4.4K or 4.7K.
    Fixed in Rev 4 - used 3.3K

OEWE to WE assertion circuit needs to be re-done to not load SOCKET_OE and
also to drive FLASH_WE from GND (dual MOSFET solution).
    Fixed in Rev 4

2.2K to LED pull-up is too slow for WE signal. Need a faster solution.
    Fixed in Rev 4 - Changed to 1K pull-up on WE
                     LED will now be driven by OEWE.

74FCT2244 parts are shorting 5V to 3.3V rails. Connect only 5V to these parts.

Need to add 10k pull-up to FLASH_RP
    Fixed in Rev 4

Combine RB signals to PB15.
    Fixed in Rev 4

Use spare PB0 as ADC to measure measure 5V / 2.
